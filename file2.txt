# GitHub Best Practices

1. Create a repository for each project for better organization.
2. Use descriptive README.md to explain the project, its structure, and usage.
3. For each new feature or bug fix, create a separate branch:
   - Use clear branch names like feature-login, feature-UI, bugfix-auth.
4. Open Pull Requests (PRs) to merge branches into main:
   - Add meaningful titles and descriptions
   - Review changes before merging
5. Protect the main branch if working collaboratively:
   - Enable branch protection rules
   - Require PR reviews before merging
6. Use issues to track tasks, bugs, or enhancements.
7. Tag releases when a stable version is ready.
8. Delete merged feature branches to keep the repo clean.
9. Leverage GitHub Actions or CI/CD for automated testing and deployment.

Following these steps ensures a clean, professional, and collaborative GitHub workflow.
