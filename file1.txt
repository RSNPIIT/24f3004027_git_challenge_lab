# Git Workflow Notes

1. Always start by switching to the correct branch:
   git switch <branch-name>

2. Stage changes before committing:
   git add <file1> <file2> ...

3. Commit with a meaningful message:
   git commit -m "Brief but descriptive commit message"

4. Push changes to remote:
   git push origin <branch-name>

5. For feature work:
   - Create a new branch for each feature
   - Make commits incrementally
   - Raise a Pull Request (PR) for review and merge

6. After merging, delete merged feature branches locally and remotely:
   git branch -d <branch-name>
   git push origin --delete <branch-name>

These practices keep the repo organized and make collaboration easier.
