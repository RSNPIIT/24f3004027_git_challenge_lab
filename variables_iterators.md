Variables and Iterators

1. Variables

A variable is like a storage box where you can keep information.

Each box has a name so you can find it later.

Examples of things you can store: numbers, words, or even lists of items.

Example:

age = 20 → A box named age contains the number 20.

name = "Ramrup" → A box named name contains the word “Ramrup”.

2. Iterators

An iterator is something that goes through a collection of items one by one.

Think of it like a bookmark that helps you read each item in a list.

Example:

You have a list of fruits: fruits = ["apple", "banana", "mango"]

An iterator can go through the list:

First: apple

Second: banana

Third: mango

3. Why they are useful

Variables help you store and remember information.

Iterators help you process items in a collection one by one, without manually checking each item.
