Git/GitHub challenge lab for IITM hands on workshop
This is my repository for the special hands on worksop

Scenario 1: Python Arithmetic Project

Title: Python Arithmetic Project – Scenario 1

Description:

This is a small Python project demonstrating basic arithmetic operations.
Users can input two numbers, and the program computes:

Sum (addition)

Difference (subtraction)

Product (multiplication)

The project uses separate Python modules for each operation to showcase modular programming and good Git workflow practices.

Files & Purpose:

File	Purpose
main.py	Main program, takes input and calls other modules
sum_module.py	Function to add two numbers
difference.py	Function to subtract two numbers
product.py	Function to multiply two numbers

Scenario 2: HTML Personal Profile

Title: HTML Personal Profile – Scenario 2

Description:

This is a small web application built using HTML to showcase my personal profile.
The project contains three pages:

Home (index.html)

About Me (about.html)

Contact (contact.html)

Each page links to the others, demonstrating simple navigation.
The pages are styled lightly using internal CSS for a clean and consistent look.

Files & Purpose:

File	Purpose
index.html	Home page, welcome message, links to other pages
about.html	About me page, info about my skills and interests
contact.html	Contact info including email, LinkedIn, GitHub

Scenario 3: Documentation of My Favorite Course Markdown File

My favorite course in Semester 1 is Computational Thinking (CT), taught by Prof. Madhavan Mukund at IIT Madras. This course introduced us to problem-solving in a computational way. We learned how to break problems into smaller steps, think logically, and design clear solutions.

Some of the key topics covered were understanding problems, creating algorithms, writing pseudo-code, logical reasoning, pattern recognition, and simple exercises to practice these concepts.

I liked this course because it helped me think like a programmer even without prior coding experience, improved my problem-solving skills, and made complex problems easier to handle. Prof. Madhavan Mukund made the classes engaging and fun.

Overall, CT gave me a strong foundation in thinking computationally, which has been useful in later courses and programming projects.
